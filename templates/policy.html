<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h3>Registration</h3>
When you register we save your username, password (hashed) and invite metadata you used to register.

<h3>Linking Discord account</h3>
When you connect your Discord account to Xello.Blue account we save your e-mail, account id, username and discriminator. We can also collect the servers you are in if we feel like you may be a threat. After connecting we will join you on our discord server

<h3>Uploading</h3>
When you upload a file on to our server and we connect the file with your account. The file is accessible for everyone that have the link or name for the file

<h3>Account Termination</h3>
If you choose to delete your account (or you get terminated by staff), we will reset your account (all of your data will be deleted from the account), we then change the account name. Meaning that your account stays, but sensitive data tied to it won't. The posts you made will stay on the server and you can access them if you have the url.

<h3>File Deletion</h3>
When you delete a file, we will delete it from our server and from your gallery.

<h3>Disclosing Your Data</h3>
We will disclose your information if it is needed to do so by the government or the law. To disclose your information we will ask for your consent to do so.
